### Hello, I'm Jo√£o Vit√≥rio or just Jo√£o, I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil!

**Who am I**

My whole life was based on helping people, discovering new things all over the web and listening to Rock and Roll <3 When I was a kid, I liked surfing the web using some friends' computers because I came from a family that couldn't make it paying for one and even that was cool because I learned to love reading a lot because I don‚Äôt always have a computer. My first contact with development was in college and with Rocketseat, I developed my first website in a college work using basic HTML and CSS and since then I am a person who loves to build something on the web.

**I work with**

Today I am a Software Engineer with a focus on JavaScript, React and Node, but I like working in other technologies too, I like working in communities and supporting people when I have time and I like it a lot.

In a nutshell, it's me, I'm a man who likes to program in JavaScript and play the guitar in his spare time: p I live in Brazil and one of my dreams is to work in another country to have the possibility to get to know other cultures!
